  description: Top-level library barrel file - main entry point exports
  rationale: |
    The main entry point for the library (src/index.ts). Defines the public API
    by re-exporting from submodules. Consumers import from here.

    Use for: The top-level src/index.ts file only.
    Don't use for: Sub-module index files (use layer-specific barrels).
  constraints:
    - rule: max_file_lines
      value: 100
      exclude_comments: true
      severity: warning
      why: Main entry barrel can be larger but should only contain exports
  hints:
    - This is the main library entry point
    - Re-export public API from submodules
