  description: CLI barrel/index files - re-exports only
  rationale: |
    Index files that re-export from other modules for cleaner imports.
    No implementation logic, only export statements.

    Use for: index.ts files that consolidate exports from a directory.
    Don't use for: Files with any implementation logic.
  constraints:
    - rule: max_file_lines
      value: 100
      severity: warning
      why: Barrel files grow with commands - 100 lines allows ~35 imports
