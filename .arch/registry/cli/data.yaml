archcodex.cli.data:
  inherits: archcodex.cli
  description: Companion data files with exported constants and templates
  rationale: |
    Files that export string constants, template literals, or static configuration data.
    These support command files by extracting large data blobs to stay under line limits.

    Use for: Template strings, constant maps, embedded documentation literals.
    Don't use for: Files with logic (use core.domain), CLI commands (use cli.command).
  constraints:
    - rule: max_file_lines
      value: 1000
      severity: warning
      why: Data files can be large but should stay reasonable
    - rule: forbid_pattern
      value: 'new Command\('
      pattern: 'new Command\('
      severity: error
      why: Data files must not define CLI commands
  hints:
    - Only export constants — no logic, no side effects
    - Extracted from command files to reduce their size
