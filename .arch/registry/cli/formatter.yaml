  inherits: archcodex.cli
  mixins:

    - tested
  description: Output formatters (JSON, Human-readable)
  rationale: |
    Pure functions that transform data structures into formatted output strings.
    Separated from commands to allow multiple output formats (JSON, human, compact).

    Use for: Files that convert result objects into displayable strings.
    Don't use for: Data processing or business logic (use core).
  expected_intents: [cli-output]
  constraints:
    - rule: forbid_import
      value:
        - commander
        - ts-morph
      severity: error
      why: Formatters should only transform data, not interact with CLI or AST
  hints:
    - Formatters are pure functions - input data, output string
    - No side effects in formatters
