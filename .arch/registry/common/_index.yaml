  inherits: base
  description: Common foundation - zero dependencies on other layers
  rationale: |
    The lowest layer containing pure types and constants shared everywhere.
    Has zero dependencies on other application layers to avoid circular imports.

    Use for: Shared constants, error codes, and foundational types.
    Don't use for: Business logic, I/O operations, or anything with side effects.
  constraints:
    - rule: forbid_import
      value:
        - ../core
        - ../cli
        - ../validators
        - ../llm
        - fs
        - path
      severity: error
      why: Common layer is the foundation - no external dependencies
  hints:
    - Pure types and constants only
    - No I/O operations
    - No side effects
