  description: Error types and codes - the error contract
  rationale: |
    Error type definitions and error codes used throughout the application.
    Provides consistent error handling with structured, serializable errors.

    Use for: Error classes, error codes, and error utility functions.
    Don't use for: Throwing errors (that happens where errors occur).
  constraints:
    - rule: max_file_lines
      value: 200
      exclude_comments: true
      severity: warning
      why: Error definitions can be extensive but should stay focused
    # Coverage: Every error code must be used somewhere in the codebase
    - rule: require_coverage
      value:
        source_type: object_keys
        source_pattern: "ErrorCodes"
        in_files: "src/utils/errors.ts"
        target_pattern: "ErrorCodes.${value}"
        in_target_files: "src/**/*.ts"
      severity: warning
      why: Error codes should be used; unused codes indicate dead code
  hints:
    - Define error codes as constants
    - Error classes should be simple and serializable
    - Include toJSON() for structured error output
