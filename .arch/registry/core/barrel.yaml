archcodex.core.barrel:
  inherits: archcodex.core
  kind: organizational
  mixins:
    - barrel
  description: Barrel/index files - re-exports only
  rationale: |
    Index files that consolidate exports from core modules.
    Makes imports cleaner: import { X } from './core' vs individual files.

    Use for: index.ts files in core directories.
    Don't use for: Files with implementation logic.
  constraints:
    - rule: max_file_lines
      value: 50
      severity: warning
      why: Core barrels should only contain exports
  hints:
    - Keep alphabetically sorted for maintainability
