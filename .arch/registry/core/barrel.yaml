archcodex.core.barrel:
  inherits: archcodex.core
  kind: organizational
  mixins:
    - barrel
  description: Barrel/index files - re-exports only
  rationale: |
    Index files that consolidate exports from core modules.
    Makes imports cleaner: import { X } from './core' vs individual files.

    Use for: index.ts files in core directories.
    Don't use for: Files with implementation logic.
  constraints:
    - rule: max_file_lines
      value: 200
      severity: warning
      why: Core barrels should only contain exports - larger modules may need more lines for comprehensive re-exports
  reference_implementations:
    - src/core/hydration/index.ts
  file_pattern: index.ts
  default_path: src/core
  code_pattern: |-
    /**
     * @arch archcodex.core.barrel
     *
     * Module exports barrel file.
     */
    export { MyEngine } from './engine.js';

    export type {

  hints:
    - Keep alphabetically sorted for maintainability
