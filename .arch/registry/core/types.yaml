  description: Type definitions - interfaces, types, enums only
  rationale: |
    TypeScript type definitions for the core layer. Compile-time only constructs.
    Shared across engines and domain components.

    Use for: Files named types.ts containing interfaces and type aliases.
    Don't use for: Zod schemas (use core.domain.schema), runtime code.
  hints:
    - Use readonly modifiers where appropriate
    - Group related types together
