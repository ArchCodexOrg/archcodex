archcodex.infra.config:
  inherits: archcodex.infra.adapter
  description: Configuration loading - files and environment variables
  rationale: |
    Configuration loading from files and environment variables.
    Handles missing files gracefully with sensible defaults.

    Use for: Files that load config files, credentials, or environment variables.
    Don't use for: General file I/O (use infra.fs), git operations (use infra.git).
  # All constraints inherited from infra.adapter (forbid_import: chalk, ts-morph, ../core, commander, ../cli)
  hints:
    - Handle missing config files with sensible defaults
    - Support environment variable overrides
    - Validate config structure with Zod schemas
    - Cache parsed config to avoid repeated file reads
