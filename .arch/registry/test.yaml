archcodex.test:
  inherits: base
  description: Test files - unit tests, integration tests
  rationale: |
    Test files have different constraints than production code.
    Allows console.log for debugging and any type for mocking flexibility.

    Use for: Test files (*.test.ts, *.spec.ts)
    Don't use for: Production code
  expected_intents:
    - cli-output
  constraints:
    - rule: allow_pattern
      value: "any type allowed in tests"
      pattern: ':\s*any\b'
    - rule: allow_pattern
      value: "console allowed in tests"
      pattern: 'console\.(log|error|warn)'
    - rule: naming_pattern
      value:
        pattern: ^\S+\.(test|spec)\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$
      severity: error
      why: Test files must have .test or .spec suffix
  hints:
    - Use descriptive test names that explain what behavior is being tested
    - Group related tests with describe blocks
    - Cover happy path, edge cases, and error handling
    - Keep tests focused and independent

archcodex.test.unit:
  inherits: archcodex.test
  description: Unit tests - isolated, fast, focused
  rationale: |
    Unit tests for individual modules with mocked dependencies.
    Should be fast and isolated from external systems.

    Use for: tests/unit/**/*.test.ts
    Don't use for: Integration tests or end-to-end tests
  file_pattern: ${name}.test.ts
  default_path: tests/unit
  constraints:
    - rule: location_pattern
      value: tests/unit/
      severity: warning
      why: Unit tests should be in tests/unit/ directory
  hints:
    - Mock external dependencies (file system, network, etc.)
    - Test one behavior per test case
    - Keep tests fast (no I/O, no external services)
    - Use factories or builders for test data

archcodex.test.integration:
  inherits: archcodex.test
  description: Integration tests - test multiple components together
  rationale: |
    Integration tests that exercise multiple components working together.
    May involve real file system operations in temp directories.

    Use for: tests/integration/**/*.test.ts
    Don't use for: Unit tests with mocked dependencies
  file_pattern: ${name}.test.ts
  default_path: tests/integration
  constraints:
    - rule: location_pattern
      value: tests/integration/
      severity: warning
      why: Integration tests should be in tests/integration/ directory
  hints:
    - Use temp directories for file operations
    - Clean up after tests (use beforeEach/afterEach)
    - Test realistic workflows end-to-end
    - May be slower than unit tests - that's OK
